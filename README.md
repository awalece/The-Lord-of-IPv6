# The-Lord-of-IPv6

This project is created as part of the APNIC IPv6 Hackathon 2018 held during APRICOT 2018 in Kathmandu. The background is that there are lots of online sources that show the IPv6 deployment status per country. But, in order to get those information, someone needs to visit those sites separately. It may be inconvenient for the users. The purpose of this project is to create an website where people can get information related to the IPv6 deployment per country collected from different secondary sources.
